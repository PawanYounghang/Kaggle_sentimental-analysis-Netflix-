which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles  \\u00c2\\u00a34.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas  russia s fourth-biggest oil producer. many observers believe that the unit  which produces 60% of yukos  oil output  could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom  the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.  the russian government forced the sale of yukos  most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. yukos  us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of us bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. on wednesday  yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group.  we believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us   yukos spokesman mike lake told agence france press.  if it exports that oil  it will be marketing a stolen product   he added. the future ownership of yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that baikal was established as a front for other interests.  speaking on tuesday  president putin said baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other russian energy firms interested in the development of yuganskneftegas. president putin also suggested that china s national petroleum corporation could play a role in the unit s future after signing a commercial agreement with gazprom to work on joint energy projects. yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. commentators and yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder  mikhail khodorkovsky.\",\n          \"small firms  hit by rising costs  rising fuel and materials costs are hitting confidence among the uk s small manufacturers despite a rise in output  business lobby group the cbi says.  a cbi quarterly survey found output had risen by the fastest rate in seven years but many firms were seeing the benefits offset by increasing expenses. the cbi also found spending on innovation  training and retraining is forecast to go up over the next year. however  firms continue to scale back investment in buildings and machinery.  the cbi said companies are looking to the government to lessen the regulatory load and are hoping interest rates will be kept on hold.  smaller manufacturers are facing an uphill struggle   said hugh morgan williams  chair of the cbi s sme council.  the manufacturing sector needs a period of long-term stability in the economy.  the cbi found some firms managed to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many said increases failed to keep up the rise in costs. of the companies surveyed  30% saw orders rise and 27% saw them fall. the positive balance of plus 3 compared with minus 10 in the previous survey. when firms were questioned on output volume  the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - the highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when looking ahead to the next three months.\",\n          \"injury doubts beset wales squad wales have a clutch of injury worries before wednesday s international friendly against hungary in cardiff.  west ham s gavin williams (ankle) looks certain to be out  so uncapped wrexham defender stephen roberts is drafted in. defenders danny gabbidon and gareth roberts  plus ryan giggs have hamstring concerns  while there are also doubts over robbie savage (groin). however  manchester united winger giggs is expected to recover in time to earn his 50th cap at the millennium stadium. there were also doubts over gabbidon s fellow cardiff defender rhys weston  but the full-back appears to have shrugged off the knock he picked up in the bluebirds  1-0 loss to west ham on sunday. the news leaves wales boss john toshack short in defence for his first game in charge  with aston villa s mark delaney injured and james collins with the under-21s. that could clear the way for new faces danny collins and dave partridge to make their wales debuts.  coyne (burnley)  jones (wolves)  roberts (wrexham)  collins (sunderland)  edwards (wolves)  gabbidon (cardiff)  page (cardiff)  partridge (motherwell)  ricketts (swansea)  roberts (tranmere)  weston (cardiff)  davies (tottenham)  fletcher (west ham)  giggs (man utd)  koumas (west brom)  robinson (sunderland)  savage (blackburn)  williams (west ham)  bellamy (newcastle)  earnshaw (west brom)  hartson (celtic).\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

pension credit guarante level of \\u00e2\\u00a3105.45. that s what we re call for. mani pension are disadvantag by the current system. if we ve got one in five pension below the poverti line we ve got to make it more gener or have these peopl live in poverty. we ve drawn up a pension manifesto. thi will be sent to each of the candid in the 659 constituencies. they will be ask which of the top five issu includ the pension issu they would support. onc we ve got their respons we will publish the result within the constitu and nation as well. it s our way of put the politician on notice. we are tri to get across the fact that there are 11m voter over 60 in the countri they are more like to vote than other section of societi and thirdli they are true swing voters. befor 1997 most pension vote conservative. in 1997 and 2001 they vote labour. but there is no guarante they will vote for a labour govern thi time around. they cannot take that vote for granted. pension gener will certainli be a big elect issu even though the govern ha postpon the public of adair turner s full report into the issue. he said the uk had one of the least gener pension system in the develop world. that the govern take serious the impact of aviat on the environment. we haven t work out specif plan but i imagin we will lobbi polit parti and incumb mps. variou local group will do that in their particular area and we will provid a nation briefing. we don t have ani larg demonstr plan but they can t be rule out. it is hard to say whether we will be successful. we have got the issu in the public conscious to an extent but it is difficult to say whether an elect will rais it import in the public mind or whether it will be push out by big issu like iraq. repeal the hunt bill. we are challeng the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action. we are hope to hear in the new year. whichev way the court rule the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in election time. when the ban come into forc on 18 februari we will be go to the european court becaus no compens is be paid. so there s a lot of legal territori to go. we are tri to engag with the minist by demonstr and talking. whatev intellig we get we will tri to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (rural affair minister) alun michael ha avoid us and cancel engag so that make it difficult. it is not intimidatori - on the whole it is group of angri housewives. of cours there is an element of shout becaus peopl are angri but there is no violenc becaus that doe not achiev anything. it will fall plumb in the run up to the most import gener elect toni blair will ever face. it s exactli what the prime minist did not want. he want the issu off the tabl until after the election. peopl use live anim as target for sport both here and abroad. the reason for includ abroad is becaus of trophi hunting. it is anoth sort of form of shoot for sport. the principl is the same whether it s a tiger or a pheasant. we will wide publicis what s happen in relat to trophi hunting. we will publicis the darker aspect of the target anim industri the uk. we will seek to get pledg from individu mp and would-b mp say that they are against the use of anim as target for sports. we would like the support of polit parti but i think a gener elect is veri much to do with pledg mp make to their electors. with hunt we had mani mp who were happi to say they were against it. i think what we will get is a veri real climb up the agenda. whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure. but it will mobilis public opinion. everyth we do will reduc anim suffer and in time that will lead to a ban. the issu that we think is the most import for thi elect is choice. the languag of consumer is veri commonplac in govern and across the polit spectrum. choic as an ideolog is begin to be the privatis of thi decade. it s becom an issu in itself but what s realli miss from the debat is the consum s choic in that. choic is not choic at all if all you have to choos from is two fail schools. we have seen so mani pension mis-sel scandal and in the pension industri there s a maximum of choic but a minimum qualiti in that. we want choic on the consum s term - that mean clear and access inform to oper that choice. firstli we have our website. it featur our campaign and chang everi day. secondli through our 700 000 member who commun with us. thirdli through the media and also what we will be do is hold a pre-elect conference. we will invit the opinion former mp journalist and others. the idea is that we open up commun between member of the public and the politicians. i think we will be successful. it s veri much the languag be use by the main polit parties. politician on all side are veri sensit to thi issu they want to be seen to be respond to thi issue. fuel duti is a larg part of oper cost for road haulag workers. we have been hear about thi propos increas of 1.92p per litr that gordon brown ha been postpon and postponing. tuppenc doe not sound like a great deal but everi year if you oper one vehicl that s an increas of about \\u00e2\\u00a3750. if you re run 10 vehicl it s obvious 10 time that. if fuel duti doe rise we will be absolut horrified. there will be a huge effect throughout the industri and i would not be surpris if you see widespread demonstrations. what it will mean is there will be a number of firm go out of business. we will continu to do what we have alway done we keep the issu in the trade press. regrett it s one of those stori that it is get harder to get into the nation press. whatev we do the public don t like lorri - they see us as a complain minority. but they don t realis that when you see a car on the road it is probabl go to work when you see a lorri it s alreadi at work.\",\n          \"ring of steel combat net attack gambl is huge popular especi with tech-savvi criminals. mani extortionist are target net-bas bet firm and threaten to crippl their websit with delug of data unless a ransom is paid. but now deep defenc are be put in place by some of the uk s biggest net firm to stop these attacks. increas number of attack and the huge amount of data be use to tri to bump a site off the web are prompt firm to adopt the measures. net firm are realis that it s not just about anti-viru and firewal said paul king chief secur architect at cisco. there are more thing that can be done in the network to protect data centres. mr king said the onli way to properli combat these so-cal distribut denial-of-servic attack wa with intellig net-bas systems. mani of the gambl site suffer ddo attack are in offshor data and host centr so ani larg scale data flood could knock out access to mani more site than just the one the crimin were target said mr king. thi overspil effect wa onli like to grow as attack grow in size and scale. malcolm seagrav secur expert at energi said the most common type of attack hit site with 10 megabyt of data over short period of time. bigger attack send down 200 megabyt of traffic or more were rare seen he said. it doe feel like they are turn the dial becaus you see thi traffic gradual grow he said. so far there have been no attack involv gigabyt of data said mr seagrave. howev he ad that it wa onli a matter of time befor such larg attack were mounted. maria capella spokeswoman for net provid pipex said that when ddo attack were at their height custom were get hit everi four to five days. the defenc be put in place constantli monitor the stream of data flow across network and pluck out the traffic destin for target sites. it s about understand what s genuin traffic and keep attack traffic from go to the site she said. we studi the profil of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomali in the profil that s when we start to get the backbon engin boy to see if we are go to sustain an attack said ms capella. thi traffic can be hard to spot becaus ddo attack typic use thousand of comput in mani differ countri each particip machin onli send a small part of the entir data flood. typic these comput have been infect by a viru or worm which report it success and the net address of compromis machin back to the malici hacker or hi-tech crimin that set off the virus. hijack comput are known as zombi or bot and collect of them are call bot nets. mani spammer rent out bot net to help them anonym send junk mail. most of the zombi are base outsid the countri that host the target site so get the attack pc shut off can be difficult. often pipex and other net supplier do get advanc notic that an attack is about to happen. the seriou player tend to preced an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail said ms capella. we ask as part of the servic we provid that custom notifi us of anyth they have in advanc that would give us forewarning. onc an attack is spot dedic net hardwar take over to remov the attack traffic and ensur that site stay up. energi took a similar approach said mr seagrave. we have technolog out there that allow us to detect attack in minut rather than let network engin spend hour pull the inform togeth said mr seagrave. also net firm were start to work more close togeth on the problem of ddo attack and pool inform about where they are come from. inform gather on attack and where they origin ha led to some arrests. he said energi also did it own intellig work to get in insight into which site crimin gang plan to target. we have peopl in place where they shouldn t be monitor tech site he said. sometim though he said spot the next victim wa easy. you can see them go alphabet through the list with the gambl site tri one after anoth said mr seagrave.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

 i was not leant on  the attorney general has again denied being  leant on  by downing street to make the legal case for invading iraq.  claims a written answer on the legality of the war was drafted by downing street were  wholly unfounded   he insisted during stormy lords exchanges. lord goldsmith said the answer represented his  genuinely held independent view  the war was legal. the text was released on the eve of a crucial commons vote in which mps backed the invasion of iraq. many labour mps have since indicated that the attorney general s answer played a pivotal role in their willingness to back the conflict. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice  saying such papers are always kept confidential. in the house of lords  the attorney general faced a call by former tory lord chancellor lord mackay to now publish the  full text  of the advice - the suggestion was rejected. another peer meanwhile  lord skidelsky  said not to publish the full legal opinion would  strengthen the suspicion that the the original text was doctored for public consumption  in exactly the same way as the notorious intelligence dossier on weapons of mass destruction .  last week lord goldsmith said in a statement:  i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised  and of course approved  the answer.  he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman  two of his own officials  three foreign office officials  a qc  christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor  lord irvine of lairg.  no other minister or official was involved in any way.   as i have always made clear  i set out in the answer my own genuinely held  independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions   he said.  the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government.  former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith s admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled.  the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary  but others certainly did   he said.  what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full  accurate summary of his formal opinion.   tony blair has dismissed questions about the attorney general s advice  and said his parliamentary statement had been a  fair summary  of his opinion.  that s what he [lord goldsmith] said and that s what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again   mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue. on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential  tory mp michael mates  who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry  told the bbc:  that  as a general rule  is right  but it s not an absolute rule.  he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published  most recently regarding prince charles s marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention  he said. mr mates added:  this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.  a book published by philippe sands qc  a member of cherie blair s matrix chambers says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action. a short statement about lord goldsmith s position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this.\",\n          \"no seasonal lift for house market a swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the uk property market.  the council of mortgage lenders (cml)  british bankers association (bba) and building societies association (bsa) all said mortgage lending was slowing. cml figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in november as the number of people buying new homes fell. elsewhere  the bba added underlying mortgage lending rose by \\u00c2\\u00a34m in november  compared to october s \\u00c2\\u00a34.29m. the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85 000 - the lowest total seen since february 2003.  data from the cml showed lending fell to just over \\u00c2\\u00a325bn in november  from \\u00c2\\u00a325.5bn a year earlier. separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year  at a seasonally-adjusted \\u00c2\\u00a32.98bn. the figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a  winter sale  and slash prices by up to 8%. miles shipside  commercial director at rightmove  said sellers would have to be  more realistic with their asking prices  to tempt buyers. the average asking price of a home fell by more than \\u00c2\\u00a3600 from \\u00c2\\u00a3190 329 in november to \\u00c2\\u00a3189 733 in december  while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.  rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago.  even once the quieter holiday period is over  sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. in any business  excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices   mr shipside said.   the proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling  even in the current market.  overall  asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their july peaks as the equivalent of \\u00c2\\u00a36 500 has been cut from an average property. a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005.  what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market  but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole   cml director general michael coogan said.  it s a fairly consistent picture  showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again  which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market   investec economist philip shaw said.  however  the figures do suggest only a modest weakening  and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time  though a collapse is still unlikely.\",\n          \"cuba winds back economic clock fidel castro s decision to ban all cash transactions in us dollars in cuba has once more turned the spotlight on cuba s ailing economy.  all conversions between the us dollar and cuba s  convertible  peso will from 8 november be subject to a 10% tax. cuban citizens  who receive money from overseas  and foreign visitors  who change dollars in cuba  will be affected. critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards  reflecting the cuban president s desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. in a live television broadcast announcing the measure  president castro s chief aide said it was necessary because of the united states  increasing  economic aggression .  the ten percent obligation applies exclusively to the dollar by virtue of the situation created by the new measures of the us government to suffocate our country   he said.  the bush administration has taken an increasingly harsh line on cuba in recent months. president bush s government  which has been a strong supporter of the 40-year-old trade embargo on cuba  introduced even tighter restrictions on cuba in may.  cubans living in the us are now limited to one visit to cuba every three years and they can only send money to their immediate relatives. a leading expert on the cuban economy says that castro s tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture.  i think it is primarily an effort to raise some cash   says jose barrionuevo  head of strategy for latin american emerging markets for barclays capital.  it underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue.   the tax will hit the families of cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. this money  known as remittances  can amount to as much as $1bn a year. those remaining in cuba will have to pay the tax. their relatives abroad may choose to send money in other currencies which are not subject to the tax  such as euros  or increase their dollar payments to compensate. however  many of cuban s poorest citizens could be worse off as a result. the tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit cuba every year  particularly those americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there.  cuba s tourist industry has been one of its few economic success stories over the last ten years and  according to the un economic commission for latin america  is now worth $3bn to the country.  the tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for cuba s cash-strapped economy. cuba badly needs dollars to pay for essential items such as food  fuel and medicine. much of cuba s basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. in recent weeks  cuba has suffered its most serious power cuts in a decade and there have also been water shortages in parts of the island. cuba s economy had staged a modest recovery during the mid 1990s as the collapse of the soviet union forced it to embrace foreign capital  decentralise trade and permit limited private enterprise. however  a decline in foreign tourism since 2002  periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. it has however yet to be seen if the tax will provide a solution to the government s economic problems. the tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading  mr barrionuevo said.  the main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries  like venezuela  which have restrictions on capital   he says.
